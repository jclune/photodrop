README

Upload a photo, glamorize it with hearts, text, and even a mustache ;)

DEMO: server down.

Code is based in javascript, HTML5, and CSS3, and optimized for iOS6 safari browser.
PhotoUp is inspired by UK style photo booth and Japanese "Puri Kura". The code is pretty messy because I'm a beginner in Javascript. And obviously we need an artist!
