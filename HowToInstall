How to Install

dropPhoto is a website. Simply put index.html and all the folders in public_html.

The main javascript is in the HTML5 file, but it also makes references to .js files 
in the js folder. In the future it can be packaged it into a .js file to be 
embedded in other mobile sites, but right now it requires the CSS style shit to
display buttons etc. You must read the copyright (GNU Public License) before copying
and redistributing dropPhoto. It is located in the file name COPYRIGHT and it can be
viewed at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Thank you!
